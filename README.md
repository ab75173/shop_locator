# Coffee Shop Locator

Shop Locator is an application that allows a user to input an address or place and will return ten of the closest coffee shops.

### Technologies Used

* Ruby 2.1.1
* Rails 4.1.1
* [Geocoder](http://www.rubygeocoder.com/)
* [Google Place API - Pleace Search](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/search)

### Configuration

To setup app, run 'bundle install', 'rake db:migrate', 'rails s' and the app will display on 'localhost:3000'

### Notes

* I would like to incorprate a map to display closest coffee locations visaully rather than a list
* Ability for users to login and logout, follow other users, and add coffee shops to a favorites list
* Work on styling and UX and mobile view
